This game is designed by Arturo Guerzoni as part of the Individual 2D assigmnet for SDSU CS583. 
This final design slightly varies from the one outlined in the original project. 
I decided to avoid the transitions in between biomes, deciding to focus more on the sound design aspect of the game. 
The background music is recorded by me and a close friend and we made the riff up based on the idea of the game.
